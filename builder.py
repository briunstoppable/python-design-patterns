# Crafted with supporting information from https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/python/example

# Usage examples: 
#    The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in Python world. 
# Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.
# Identification: 
#    The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class,  which has a single creation method 
# and several methods to configure the resulting object. 
# Builder methods often support chaining 
# Example: 
#    someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).

# Let's use a builder to customize a laptop object. 
# We could then export this as JSON and store it in a database with a customer profile until they're ready to order.
